# Programming-Skills-Challenge

In the fifth question, "Write a Unit Test using C/C++ or Java for the function ConcatRemove(s, t, k)", it is not explicitly required to use the Catch2 testing framework. The question allows you to use either C/C++, Java, or any other programming language of your choice to write the unit test.

However, if you decide to use the Catch2 testing framework in C++, it can be beneficial as Catch2 provides a simple and expressive syntax for writing tests, making it popular among C++ developers.

If you choose to use Catch2 for writing the unit test, make sure you have installed Catch2 and set it up in your C++ project before writing the tests. The test file should include the appropriate Catch2 header and use the provided macros (e.g., TEST_CASE, REQUIRE) to define and run the test cases.
